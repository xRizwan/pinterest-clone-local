## Pinterest-Clone
<br/>

> Made as the final project for the javascript-section of TheOdinProject.
> Its a simple social-media website where users can create/save/delete or comment on Pins.
>
> Instead of the standard way pinterest works i,e (creating boards), the user instead specifies a "main tag" for each pin they create.
>
> Users can chat with each other and search for pins as well.<br/>
